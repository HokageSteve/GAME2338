# Game Review for (Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories)

## Details

### Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories

### Rating
I give Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories, a solid 5 out of 10.

## Summary
Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories is about your character which you can name so its more of a personel experience, and Yugi Moto, a kid dueling to be the best at duel monsters, and in this game, your character is a spirit within the puzzle that Yugi puts together and wears around his neck. The game is dueling other AI duelist in a tournament in order to become "King of Games" and to do so, assembling a proper deck is key.

In this game, you must create a deck and this deck must contain fourty cards no more no less, but at first the game starts you with fourty cards but as you progress and gain starchips, which are the currency for the game, and with starchips, you can purchase new cards and you get new cards from defeating other AIs in duels. There are duels outside of the campaign mode, which is the versus, were you can duel with AIs you've defeated in the story, as well as a two player versus so you can duel a friend by building your decks with the cards you get.

The duel process is somewhat simple, with you putting down monster cards that are stronger than your opponent's monsters, and usuing magic cards to boost your monsters, heal your life points, and attack your opponents monsters, or you can use trap cards which protect your monsters or attack your opponent, and the way a duel ends is either give up or completely drian your opponents lifepoints down to zero. 

An important aspect of the game is to combine certain monsters in order to summon stronger monsters to overpower your opponent, but not all monsters combine with any, and knowing which monster card combines with what will help to build your deck appropriately. Though the game doesn't give any idea to what monsters are able to fuse, thus making it hard to build a good deck with monsters that fuse.

## Final Thoughts
My final thoughts are that, even though I really enjoyed this game, mainly because I happen to like Yu-Gi-Oh, this game is lacking a bit, with no tutorials, no practice or training modes, and no way of knowing which monsters fuse, makes it difficult to even beat the first AIs, and this is the reason for my rating. But if you look up the FAQ for the monsters fusions, it really helps in giving you a fighting chance, but still a fun game to just mess around in.
