### Rating
After playing this game for some time, I would give it a solid 7 out of 10.

## Summary
This game is about a lad named Henry, who is the son of the local blacksmith, but usually seems to get into trouble with his friends and seems to visit the tavern often. The game is set in Bohemia, Europe in the early 1400s and is during a time of war. After his village named skalitz is destroyed and parents mudered and forced to flee, he finds himeself heading to a castle called Talegam. where the story continues from there. The gameplay is a very involved and takes time to get a handle on certain mechanics. For starters on some of the basic and neat mechanics of this game are keeping your character nourished by eating different types of food that give different levels of nourishment and his energy up by sleeping. This game also has a night and day feature which falls into night time shenanigians, and the CPUs being open for business or asleep in thier homes. Speaking of the CPUs, another mechanic of this game are dialog options with the different CPUs which can also have success or fail dialog responses based on your characters speech, charisma, and strength points against the character your talking to. As well as whether your characters reputation, clothes and hygiene will have different status effects in dialog options success or fails, and traders will fear the player if they happen to have blood on their clothes or their sword drawn. The combat style is also very unique with the player being able to slash in 5 different directions and stabbing, giving the player more combo options and reading the opponents movements and where to hit next.  this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarising the gameplay mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
