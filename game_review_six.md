## Summary
Depth is a multiplayer game about a group of divers going into the watery depths looking for treasure with their robot named STEVE, mean while they are being hunted my two sharks. The objective of the game is simple either the survivors win by getting Steve to the end of the level or kill all the sharks, and the sharks win by destroying Steve or killing all the survivors and both teams have 20 lives shared between their teammates. 

The survivors have a multitude of weapons at their disposal, though in order to get better and bigger weapons, the survivors must get treasure and with the money, they can buy better weapons as well as upgrades for those weapons, but to buy better eapons they must unlock them playing the game. They can also use flares and other equipment such as turrents to see in the dark adn defend against sharks, and in order to heal they must used medkits found in the ocean.

The sharks are two in number but can break through walls and charge at the survivors, as well as having sonar to see through walls knowing where the survivors are and using the mouse, can rip them apart killing the survivors faster. The sharks get upgrades by evolving, thus giving them abilitis they can use to get an upperhand on the survivors and battle against their equipment; and when the sharks need to heal they only have to eat the seals found in the area using their sonar.

## Final Thoughts
Depth is a great game and I really do like playing it when I can, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes the ocean and wants a thrilling experience.
