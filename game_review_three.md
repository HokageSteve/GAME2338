### Rating
I rate this game a solid 7 out of 10.

## Summary
Trials Fusion is a platforming racing game, where the player races to the goal for the best time in hopes of reaching the gold tier time, theres also a silver and bronze time prize as well. Trials Fusion is the fifth game in the series of trials games, and is pretty fun in my opinion, as someone who doesn't play racing games often, this had me playin for a while. The signle player mode is different chapters of levels that the player must race to the goal in order to unlock the next level and move on to the next chapter of the story, yes theres somewhat of a story and its a little funny. There are leaderboards in this game and it can get pretty competitive and lots of fun in multiyplayer, espesially when using the ragdoll feature, where the player bails off the vehicle to either get to the finish line first or just for funny clips. The player can also customize the character or even the bikes for a more personal feel to the game. There are a variety of vehicle styles to choose from and differ in speed and control which is a nice touch to the players style, of course you have to unlock them as you play. Multiplayer is played up to 4 racers in local play and online with 8 players which can get pretty crazy, all with the gaol of making it to the goal first. There is also a track editor mode, so players can create custom tracks for other players or friends to try out, and the detail that went into the editor, giving the player freedom of not only objects and different track types but physics to give the track more life and even more freedom of ideas which is really nice. It feels as if your coding your own track for other players, with triggers the player will pass to trigger an event that'll help them progress or even mess with them depending on the creaters design.

## Final Thoughts
My final thoughts are, that Trials Fusion is a really fun and great successor to the previous trials games and definitely be tried out by players who love racing games and funny antics, I recommend this games for friends who want to have a fun game to play at their next LAN party.
