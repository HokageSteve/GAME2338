# Bungie Testing Halo 3 

The first thing the Bungie crew does is get in around six in the morning and for the first two hours, they play Halo 3 to test the basics such as the game loads in properly, the player and enemies load into the game, weopons work how they should, and exiting the game etc. 

I feel this is a very smart move by the Bungie team to make sure the game and all assets are working, for even if they were working in the previous day, theres no guarantee that everything will work the next time or if used in a different way that was different from before, so testing the game for two hours is dedication and a very good idea to amke sure you have the best quality and working game.

One of the testing Bungie used is manual testing is where you have someone watching someone else play as an extra pair of eyes to make sure everything on screen is working at one time, from the player damage and weapons are working as well as enemy weapons and damage output.

Manuel testing is a good and simple way to check the game and with two people watching the game at once will give an oppurtunity to see something the other might have missed at that moment.

The next step that I see the Bungie crew testing is the multiplayer to make sure that if any changes were made even in single player, will it have messed up anything in the multiplayer setup, and they do this by getting multiple machines and running them in multiplayer to see if anything happens, such as bugs, delayed damage or missed damage, and crashes.
