**Question:** During your playtesting where the rules of the game understandable? If not, what was not clear.
> _Answer:_ The game is somewhat clear on what you have to do, what isn't really clear is how to go about completing the objective, in the prologue, it's obvious, the player must get an item, but as to how to do it is up to the player, for there can be multiple ways to go about it. Though in later levels it becomes more unclear as to what exactly must be done to escape. 

**Question:** During gameplay did you notice anything that shouldn't be in the game or could be removed and it wouldn't effect game play?
> _Answer:_ No, all items can be used in some way, whether its to get to different places as a foothold or climbing, or even throwing things to slow down the enemy.

**Question:** Is this game balanced? If not, what is the target audience for this game based on that imbalance?
> _Answer:_ For the most part the game is balanced, the only thing that might be a little imbalanced is the AI enemy, where spawning and knowing where the player is makes it difficult to predict, as well as the speed and was the enemy slows the player, makes it hard to catch a break. I would list this for more of the hardcore gamer, thats willing to consistently deal with the AI and puzzles. 

**Question:** Does the timing of this game appear to be about right for this type of game?
> _Answer:_ The timing is good for this type of game, its timing is mostly random, with the main timing segments being between the  AI and player, which can make the game feel longer than it actually is to do the objective and beat the level. 

**Question:** During gameplay did the mechanics and theme go together and reinforce each other?
> _Answer:_ The theme and mechanics, can clash at times, for the game is considered a stealthy game, but at some points the mechanics have you making noise that attracts the enemy to the player, making it seem more unnecessary to be stealthy.

**Question:** Did you have fun playing this game?
> _Answer:_ Yes, although the games puzzles aren't completly clear in how to solve them, the overall fear of running from the AI is thrilling and gameplay is an interesting idea. There was no real downtime or too much loading, anytime the player is caught the game resets itself and anything the player has done is saved, though the level adds more obstacles as punishment for getting caught, such as cameras, beartraps, and boarded up windows.

**Question:** During gameplay what problems or issues seemed to happen and how did you get them to reoccur?
> _Answer:_ There were no problems that I could make occur, other than getting stuck on items while running away, there were no breaks in the game I could create and easily recreate.
