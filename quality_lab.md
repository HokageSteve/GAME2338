## Game One: Modern Warfare 2
Modern Warfare 2 is a quality game for its multiplayer UI and gameplay were to me the best in the seires of games. MW2 was the sixth game in the Call of Duty franchise, but shined for its multiplayer though the story was also a good reason for its current look of the world and characters. The gameplay was great and the mechanics were easy to use in game as well as the menu, and the multiplayer menu, ranking, and customization of the players gamer card was full of different variants and options, that players could express themselves. Playing a game in multiplayer was really easy, with rare server crashes and different gametypes, it was always easy to find a game, espesially with friends, the parties system to play with friends never really gave us problems, you could team up and take on ther team players which was always a good time. With all the easy to use and understand menu system of MW2 it was to me personally the best game in the Call of Duty series when it comes to multiplayer.

## Game Two: Assassins
